# Terran Republic Interstellar Plotter System
## Introduction

**TRIPS** (the **T**erran **I**nterstellar **P**lotter **S**ystem) is intended to be a flexible stellar cartography system designed for the needs of SF fans and writers. It will allow you to: 
1. Load stellar databases from several well-known file formats.
1. Save and maintain multiple datasets for whatever purpose you have. 
1. View and edit star data in tabular form.
2. Plot your star data in 3d.
    - Centered on stars of your choice.
    - Within a radius of your choice. 
    - Based on selection criteria you create such as spectral class, polities, resources, etc. 
3. Create and plot routes between stars in multiple ways. 
4. Organize sets of stars based on purpose and interest such as polity, resources, population, etc. as well as standard astrographic information. 
5. Use for either scientific or science fiction writing purposes (such as world building.)

The program is provided with stellar datasets derived from well-known astrographic sources including Simbad and Gaia data release 2.

### Yes, TRIPS is a retronym. We knew the abbreviation we wanted and worked backwards to the words. 

_Normal people believe that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Engineers believe that if it ain't broke, it doesn't have enough features yet._
