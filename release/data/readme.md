#The Database Directory

In this directory is the file based relational database. This database is used by the embedded H2 database engine.

It will be initially created on first startup by the application and is used as the repository of all data loaded.

If you want to remove all the data, then delete these file (no the readme.md of course).

We may ask you for a copy of this to solve any issues.
