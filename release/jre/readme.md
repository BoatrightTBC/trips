#Java Runtime Environment

This directory holds a cutdown version of the java runtime.

It uses the JDK modularity architecture. The Java version is 14.0.2 although mostly java version of 11 and greater.

Carrying a copy of the JDK makes usage simpler for install, because all that is required is download, unzip and run.

Please do not touch any of the files here as they have been customized for the TRIPS application.

It isn't required that you use this JRE, you can utilize your own JVM if you choose. However, you will need to modify the runme.bat file in the main directory.
