     * The Truncated Julian Day (TJD) was introduced by NASA/Goddard in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped
     * binary time code (PB-5) "designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications."
     * TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number.
     * Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995,
     * "which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years". (NASA codes PB-1â€”PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year
     * count.) Only whole days are represented. Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day,
     * plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields. Later PB-5J was
     * introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur
     * in the year 2147. There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999
