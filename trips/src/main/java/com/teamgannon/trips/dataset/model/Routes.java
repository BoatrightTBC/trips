 * Routes are lists of stars which provide a route via jumps of no more than X light years. Generally,
 * it is my understanding that routes sort of “belong” to polities, in that they are generated by the
 * jump capabilities of a polity.  Their appearance on screen is controlled by the route objects in
 * the theme. In principle then, they’re a very simple object
